                    <H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> What is your price range (currency)?</p>
</h4><p>Our custom dress shirts start at $59 and go up from there depending on the cost of the fabric. The quality on all our shirts is always the same, excellent! All prices are listed in U.S. Dollars.</p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P>Do I have to enter my measurements every time I order a dress shirt?</p>
</h4><p>No. Our database keeps all customer information including size and mailing address. If you need to modify some information, just go into your personal profile portal and you can update your measurements and shipping address easily. As a second option, you can request any changes via email by sending a request to cs@menscustomtailor.com</p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P>Where will my shirts be made?</p></h4><p>
Every custom made dress shirt is hand made to your specifications at our factory in Asia. We have been working with this tailor for over a decade, and have a relationship that allows us to maintain our consistently superior quality. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> What if I don't like the shirts I ordered?</p></h4><p>
Our goal is 100% satisfaction. Although we have a 96% success rate of providing the right fit on your first order, we will either remake the shirt or return your money if you are not happy with the quality or workmanship of our shirts. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> I worry about the fit with a custom dress shirt, how do I know that it will be right?</p></h4><p>
 We recommend that you choose the option of sending one shirt first to try at checkout. We will send one shirt first ("test" shirt) to confirm your measurements. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> Do I need to worry about shrinkage?</p></h4><p>
 You should be aware that there is always a small shrinkage through washing (about 2 - 3%), The higher the Cotton content the more shrinkage that will occur. Deluxe Cotton and Linen will shrink more than a Cotton/Poly mix. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P>Can I order white collars and/or cuffs?</p></h4><p>
Yes. You can add this option at no additional charge. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P>Can I add monogram initials?</p></h4><p>
 Yes. You can add monogram initials on cuff, pocket or chest at no additional charge. </p>

<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> How will you ship my dress shirts?</p></h4><p>
All custom dress shirts are usually shipped within one week. They are shipped either International Priority Airmail
 or via USPS priority mail. It takes about 2-4 days for US residents and about 2-3 weeks for internatinal orders depending on your location. Non-US residents are responsible for any additional custom duties. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> Can I change my order once it's in production?</p></h4><p>
Order can only be changed or cancelled in the first 12 hrs. after order is submitted. </p>
<H4 CLASS="sub-heading"><P> What is Egyptian Cotton?</p></h4><p>
Egyptian cotton comes from the species Gossypium Barbadense, which is the same plant that Pima cotton comes from. However, the climate in Egypt, where Egyptian cotton is grown, produces a longer staple (fibers) than any other cotton. These long fibers are spun into extra-fine threads, which are then woven into a high-quality fabric. </p>
