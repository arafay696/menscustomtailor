                        <p>Mens Custom Tailor provides a cutting edge technology platform for those men who are after
                            individuality through custom apparel.</p>
                        <p>Our hundreds of different textiles range from premium European fabrics for the man who
                            demands the ultimate sophistication, down to the style conscious man who wants value for
                            money.</p>
                        <p>Most men wear dress shirts that do not fit them properly. The problem is that ready-made
                            garments are made to fit many; as a result, they fit no one perfectly. We all compromise
                            somewhere if a shirt fits us in the neck it fails us in the sleeve length; if it fits well
                            in the sleeves,
                            it billows out around the stomach.</p>
                        <p>Our website is pretty sleek and easy to navigate, which is a huge boon right away—you don&#39;t
                            want your confidence in the process diminished by some sloppy U.I. or any sense of confusion
                            in
                            ordering. You begin by selecting a fabric from the dozens and dozens of available swaths,
                            which
                            cover a fairly predictable, though certainly appealing, spectrum of colors and patterns.</p>
                        <p>Turnaround time: First-time customers should expect the process to take two to three weeks.
                            For
                            existing customers, it&#39;s usually less then two weeks turnaround. (But if you&#39;ve got an event
                            on your
                            calendar, as many of our clients do, they can get it to you in a week.)</p>
